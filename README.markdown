## FAQ ##

1. How often are my searches terms updated? - By default each search term is refreshed every 
minute.  You can adjust the query rate under the options menu.

2. How often is the trend data updated? - Sideline refreshes its trend data every 5 minutes.  It
will grab whatever is the latest data available from Twitter at that time.

3. Can I imported pre-defined search groups and related terms? - Sideline does support 
importing of pre-defined search groups.  This is useful for loading up a large amount 
of specific search groups and custom search queries without laboring through the UI each 
time.  To use this create a basic text file with a .ssf extension (Sideline Search Format).  In 
that text file you will define your search groups and custom searches using 
[JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON).  There is 
a example file included with the Sideline source code called sample.ssf.  That example 
demonstrates defining two search groups and several different searches within each.

### Additional Notes
* Sideline does phone home on startup.  This is done as a safety precaution so 
that we can put the application in maintenance mode in the event that a security issue 
is identified.  We'd take it out if we could, but our security policy prohibits this.
